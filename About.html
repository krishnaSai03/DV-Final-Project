<p>In the realm of economic analysis and education, there exists a significant challenge in effectively
presenting historical per capita income data to a diverse audience. Users, ranging from researchers
and policymakers to educators and students, often require access to clear, interactive, and insightful
visualizations of economic data to understand trends, make comparisons, and derive insights.
There is a need for a comprehensive web application that not only addresses these challenges by
providing dynamic, user-friendly visualizations of per capita income data but also facilitates easy
access to historical economic data for comparative and analytical purposes. The application must
allow users to filter data by year, country, and region; display data through interactive graphs and
maps; and present this information in a manner that is both informative and accessible to
individuals with varying levels of expertise in economic analysis.</p>
    <p>In the book FactFulness, Hans Rosling talks about how people tend to see the world as
divided into two groups: rich versus poor, developed versus developing, and so on. He uses
graphs showing the number of babies per woman and child survival rates to illustrate how the
world has changed over time. The change looks familiar for the income, tourism, education, and
healthcare, shows a significant progress. Nowadays, most people fall into the middle-income
category, suggesting there isn't a clear gap anymore. Rosling divides the world into four income
levels, which makes more sense in today's world. When we look at averages and spreads, we see
overlaps, indicating there might not be a gap at all. In comparing extremes, we find that the
majority of people fall somewhere in between. Rosling concludes that the world used to be
divided into two, but that's no longer the case. Rosling wants us to understand this complexity
and be more open-minded. We want to delve into this concept and understand in our own way</p>

    <p> GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted
to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is
the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not
included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of
employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually
converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although
an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an
exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth
fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the
World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year
and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country,
and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom,
and the United States.</p>
